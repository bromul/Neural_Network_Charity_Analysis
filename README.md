# Neural Network Charity Analysis

## Overview

This project sought to create a neural network to create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants to Alphabet Soup's grant program will be successful if funded.

### Purpose

Our friend Beks has been tasked by Alphabet Soup to create a model that can predict the success of applicants to Alphabet Soup's grant program that receive funding.  

## Results

### Data Preprocessing
- What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
- What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
- What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
- How many neurons, layers and activation functions did you select for your neural network model? Why?
- Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
- What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?

## Summary
